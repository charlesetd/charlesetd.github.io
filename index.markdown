# $FFFC

I write code to run code to scan code and sometimes I write <a href="/posts/">blog posts</a> too. I'm always working on something cool whether it be software, electronics, game development, or even homebrew pinball.

Development takes time so I can't guarantee I'll post regularly. If you like what you read, why not consider subscribing to my <a href="/feed.xml">Atom feed</a> so you never miss a new post?
